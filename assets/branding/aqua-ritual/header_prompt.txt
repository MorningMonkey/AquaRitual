Create a cinematic, premium wide header image for "AquaRitual".
Concept: A calm digital aquarium where tropical fish and aquatic plants grow as you build habits.

Composition (Header / Wide):
- Keep the CENTER area clean with generous negative space for text overlay.
- Place key aquarium elements more on the lower-left and lower-right edges.

Aquarium Elements (Must include):
- Tropical fish (realistic, premium, non-cartoon): e.g., subtle silhouettes or softly lit forms of neon tetra / guppy / angelfish.
- Aquatic plants (aquascape): soft swaying stems, foreground carpet hints, layered depth (small -> medium -> tall).
- Hardscape: smooth rounded stones + optional driftwood, sandy substrate.
- Bubbles rising (streak metaphor): small vertical chains, delicate and minimal.

Visual Style:
- Glassmorphism: frosted glass UI-like panels or subtle glass refractions (very light, not dominant).
- Lighting: underwater caustics, soft rays from above, clean highlights.
- Colors: bioluminescent cyan, pale blue, white; airy and refreshing.
- Depth: shallow depth of field (bokeh) for premium immersion.

NO:
- Any text or logos
- Cartoon/anime fish, cute characters, toy-like shapes
- Dark murky water, clutter, busy background, harsh shadows
